Hangman_node

Created Hangman using constructors, objects and Node.js that processes user input via the command line.

node modules used:
npm install prompt
npm install inquirerResponse

Run the index.js file from the command line to start the game.

Enter letters and watch the blanks get filled in as you guess correctly. You get 10 guesses. Good luck!
